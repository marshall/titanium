Description:
SpiderMonkey is the code-name for the Mozilla's C implementation of JavaScript.


Local Modifications:
* Spidermonkey was taken from the mozilla/js directory & placed in 
spidermonkey/js.
* PLDHash was taken from mozilla/xpcom/glue/pldhash.{h,c} & placed in
spidermonkey/xpcom/glue/.
* NSPR was taken from mozilla/nsprpub and placed in spidermonkey/nspr.
* Removed all files & directories produced by running the following command:
find . | egrep "tools|os2|beos|test|solaris|xpconnect|liveconnect"

Modifications to /js:
* Ran configure & make inside js/src directory and copied out the following
autogenerated files:
   - js/src/jsautocfg.h
   - js/src/jsautokw.h
* In js/src/jsautocfg.h - Changed macros to key off preprocessor for endianness,
rather than defining statically.
* In js/src/jsotypes.h - Added conditionals around typedefs of uint32 & int32,
as those are defined by Gears as well.
* Removed js/jsd & js/fdlibm directories.
* Fixed trailing "0" in #undefs in jsautocfg.h.
* TODO(jripley): Hardcoded locale in jsnum.c due to Android lacking lconv.
* Turned off JS_STATIC_ASSERT() in jsutil.h for Android. This trick is
  incompatible with the version of gcc used.
* Turned off using compiler __builtin_ctz functions in jsbit.h
  for Android as the system libraries don't seem to implement them.
* Added assert(0) in js/src/jsgc.c so we fail if JSObjects arent't cleaned up
  when a context goes away.

Modifications to /nspr:
* Added "#if defined(__i386__)" to nspr/pr/src/md/unix/os_Darwin_x86.s.
* Added "#if defined(__ppc__)" to nspr/pr/src/md/unix/os_Darwin_ppc.s.
* nspr/pr/include/md/_darwin.cfg was copied to 
nspr/pr/include/prcpucfg.h.
* Removed all directories under nspr/ apart from nspr/pr and nspr/dist.
* Added _PR_STATIC_BUILD flag in include/prtypes.h to prevent visible
  symbols in a purely static build.
* Android platform variations in the following files:
   - include/md/_linux.h
   - include/md/_ptd.h
   - include/md/_unixos.h
   - include/md/prosdep.h,
   - include/prcpucfg.h
   - src/md/prosdep.c
   - src/md/unix/unix.c
   - src/md/unix/unix_errors.c
   - src/md/unix/uxproces.c
   - src/md/unix/uxrng.c
   - src/md/unix/uxwrap.c
   - src/misc/prnetdb.c
   - src/misc/prsystem.c
   - src/pthreads/ptio.c

Modifications to /xpcom:
* Made minor changes in #include sections. All are marked 'Gears'.

Gears-only files:
* Added gears-only file at gears_include/mozjs_api.h.
* Files under gears_npapi_bindings/ are Gears-specific.
