Description: Breakpad is an open-source library for generating and processing
             crash reports from multiple platforms.

Local Modifications:
- Added this file (README.google).
- Removed directories src/processor/testdata/ & tools/ except for tools/mac/dump_syms/
- Pruned the tree to remove any directories containing the strings linux 
  or windows or solaris, by deleting all the directories returned by:
  > find -E . -regex ".*windows|.*solaris|.*linux" -type d
  or, in one fell swoop:
  > find -E . -regex ".*windows|.*solaris|.*linux" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
- Built dump_syms binary by running the following commands:
 > cd src/tools/mac/dump_syms
 > xcodebuild -configuration Release
 > mv build/Release/dump_syms .
 > rm -rf build
- changed <limits.h> include to <sys/syslimits.h> to fix 10.4 compilation in:
  src/common/mac/file_id.h
  src/common/mac/macho_id.h
