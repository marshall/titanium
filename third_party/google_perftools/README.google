Description: Currently this is only used for getting a list of memory mapped 
             regions in a process.

             Official description of code:
             These tools are for use by developers so that they can create more
             robust applications. Especially of use to those developing
             multi-threaded applications in C++ with templates. Includes
             TCMalloc, heap-checker, heap-profiler and cpu-profiler.
             
Local Modifications:
  - Added this file, README.google.
  - Remove the code for GetenvBeforeMain(), GetUniquePathFromEnv(), 
    CyclesPerSecond(), NumCPUs() because these were not needed and 
    had extra dependencies.
  - Fixed bug in ProcMapsIterator::~ProcMapsIterator by removing
    duplicate  "delete dynamic_buffer_;". (Sent mail to author.)
  - Expanded path to include files to avoid picking up copies from
    googleurl/base/basictypes.h, googleurl/base/logging.h
  - Replaced base/basictypes.h with a version that includes gear's
    basictypes.h to avoid conflics between these headers (and retains
    the scanf defines that are needed by perftools).
  - Replaced base/logging.h with a stubbed-out version.
