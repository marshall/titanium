The contents of this directory are lifted from a "sample" program written 
by Igor Tandetnik. A reference to that sample and some info about it can
be found at 

  http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.inetsdk.programming.urlmonikers/msg/76bf4910a289d4b3 

The sample code itself can be found at

Gears changes:

* Only a subset of the package PassthruAppBeta.zip has been extracted
  and submitted to perforce; the subset required to use the framework to
  build an APP.
  
* Various whitespace changes like d2u, tabs2spaces, strip trailing whitespace

* Google-style header complilation guards

* Added support for additional interfaces related to IE7:
  IInternetProtocolEx, IUri, IWinInetCacheHints, IWinInetCacheHints2
  (see urlmon_ie7_extras.h)
  
* Modifications to the class factory to not blow up when a caller
  requests an object with a particular interface (for example
  IInternetProtocolInfo) be created, returns E_NOINTERFACE in that case.
  Gears uses an InternetSession option that tickles this problem.
  (see ProtocolCF.inl)  
  
* Changed the way class objects for protocol handlers are created from 
  urlmon.dll. This was needed for Windows Mobile 5, where these class
  objects don't have ClSIDs in the registry.

* Added call to _AtlInitialConstruct() to
  CComPolyObjectSharedRef::FinalConstruct() in SinkPolicy.inl.
  This was needed in order to correctly initialize the
  critical section of CComPolyObjectSharedRef::m_content.
