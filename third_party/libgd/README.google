Description:
A small and fast graphics library for basic raster manipulation.

Local Modifications:
- The source from http://www.libgd.org/releases/gd-2.0.35.tar.bz2 was
  downloaded an extracted to third_party.
- mv gd-2.0.35 libgd
- cd libgd
- ./configure --without-freetype --without-fontconfig --without-xpm --with-png
  --with-jpeg  (this is to generate a config.h and a Makefile)
- The files listed for libgd_la_SOURCES (ie. only the library sources, not the
  supporting programs) in the generated Makefile were merged into the Gears
  Makefile.
- Remove #ifdefs around gd.h:30 to enable NONDLL in WIN32 in order to build a
  static library.
