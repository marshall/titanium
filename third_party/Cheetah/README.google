Local Modifications:

logging about using native stack frames. Library is used on
multiple platforms and we are not providing compiled binaries
in the package.
- Removed unit tests.
- Removed CheetahWrapper.py from the distribution: it has dependency on
another thirdparty optik library and we are not running it from command line.
- Removed Optik library.
