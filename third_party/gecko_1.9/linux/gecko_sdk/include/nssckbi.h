 *
 * The NSS_BUILTINS_LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR macro needs to be bumped
 * for each NSS minor release AND whenever we change the list of
 * trusted certificates.  10 minor versions are allocated for each
 * NSS 3.x branch as follows, allowing us to change the list of
 * trusted certificates up to 9 times on each branch.
 *   - NSS 3.5 branch:  3-9
 *   - NSS 3.6 branch:  10-19
 *   - NSS 3.7 branch:  20-29
 *   - NSS 3.8 branch:  30-39
 *   - NSS 3.9 branch:  40-49
 *   - NSS 3.10 branch: 50-59
 *   - NSS 3.11 branch: 60-69
 *     ...
 *   - NSS 3.14 branch: 90-99
 *     ...
 *   - NSS 3.30 branch: 250-255
 *
 * NSS_BUILTINS_LIBRARY_VERSION_MINOR is a CK_BYTE.  It's not clear
 * whether we may use its full range (0-255) or only 0-99 because
 * of the comment in the CK_VERSION type definition.
