/* rjr: PKCS #11 cert handling (pk11cert.c) does use SEC_PKCS7RecipientInfo's.
 * This is because when we search the recipient list for the cert and key we
 * want, we need to invert the order of the loops we used to have. The old
 * loops were:
 *
 *  For each recipient {
 *       find_cert = PK11_Find_AllCert(recipient->issuerSN);
 *       [which unrolls to... ]
 *       For each slot {
 *            Log into slot;
 *            search slot for cert;
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 *  the new loop searchs all the recipients at once on a slot. this allows
 *  PKCS #11 to order slots in such a way that logout slots don't get checked
 *  if we can find the cert on a logged in slot. This eliminates lots of
 *  spurious password prompts when smart cards are installed... so why this
 *  comment? If you make SEC_PKCS7RecipientInfo completely opaque, you need
 *  to provide a non-opaque list of issuerSN's (the only field PKCS#11 needs
 *  and fix up pk11cert.c first. NOTE: Only S/MIME calls this special PKCS #11
 *  function.
