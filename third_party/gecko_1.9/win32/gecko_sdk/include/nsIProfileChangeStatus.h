   /**
    * nsIObserver topics for profile changing. Profile changing happens in phases
    * in the order given below. An observer may register separately for each phase
    * of the process depending on its needs. The subject passed to the observer's
    * Observe() method can be QI'd to an nsIProfileChangeStatus.
    *
    * "profile-approve-change"
    *   Called before a profile change is attempted. Typically,
    *   the application level observer will ask the user if
    *   he/she wants to stop all network activity, close all open
    *   windows, etc. If the user says NO, the observer should
    *   call the subject's vetoChange(). If any observer does
    *   this, the profile will not be changed.
    *
    * "profile-change-teardown"
    *   All async activity must be stopped in this phase. Typically,
    *   the application level observer will close all open windows.
    *   This is the last phase in which the subject's vetoChange()
    *   method may still be called. 
    *   The next notification will be either 
    *   profile-change-teardown-veto or profile-before-change.
    *
    * "profile-change-teardown-veto"
    *   This notification will only be sent, if the profile change 
    *   was vetoed during the profile-change-teardown phase.
    *   This allows components to bring back required resources,
    *   that were tore down on profile-change-teardown.
    *
    * "profile-before-change"
    *   Called before the profile has changed. Use this notification
    *   to prepare for the profile going away. If a component is
    *   holding any state which needs to be flushed to a profile-relative
    *   location, it should be done here.
    *
    * "profile-do-change"
    *   Called after the profile has changed. Do the work to
    *   respond to having a new profile. Any change which
    *   affects others must be done in this phase.
    *
    * "profile-after-change"
    *   Called after the profile has changed. Use this notification
    *   to make changes that are dependent on what some other listener
    *   did during its profile-do-change. For example, to respond to
    *   new preferences. 
    *
    * "profile-initial-state"
    *   Called after all phases of a change have completed. Typically
    *   in this phase, an application level observer will open a new window.
    *
    * Contexts for profile changes. These are passed as the someData param to the
    * observer's Observe() method.
    
    * "startup"
    *   Going from no profile to a profile.
    *
    *   The following topics happen in this context:
    *       profile-do-change
    *       profile-after-change
    *
    * "shutdown-persist"
    *   The user is logging out and whatever data the observer stores
    *   for the current profile should be released from memory and
    *   saved to disk.
    *
    * "shutdown-cleanse"
    *   The user is logging out and whatever data the observer stores
    *   for the current profile should be released from memory and
    *   deleted from disk.
    *
    *   The following topics happen in both shutdown contexts:
    *       profile-approve-change
    *       profile-change-teardown
    *       profile-before-change
    *
    * "switch"
    *   Going from one profile to another.
    *
    *   All of the above topics happen in a profile switch.
