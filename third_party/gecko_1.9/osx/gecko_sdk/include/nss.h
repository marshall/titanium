 * This allows using application defined prefixes for the cert and key db's
 * and an alternate name for the secmod database. NOTE: In future releases,
 * the database prefixes my not necessarily map to database names.
 *
 * configdir - base directory where all the cert, key, and module datbases live.
 * certPrefix - prefix added to the beginning of the cert database example: "
 * 			"https-server1-"
 * keyPrefix - prefix added to the beginning of the key database example: "
 * 			"https-server1-"
 * secmodName - name of the security module database (usually "secmod.db").
 * flags - change the open options of NSS_Initialize as follows:
 * 	NSS_INIT_READONLY - Open the databases read only.
 * 	NSS_INIT_NOCERTDB - Don't open the cert DB and key DB's, just 
 * 			initialize the volatile certdb.
 * 	NSS_INIT_NOMODDB  - Don't open the security module DB, just 
 *			initialize the 	PKCS #11 module.
 *      NSS_INIT_FORCEOPEN - Continue to force initializations even if the 
 * 			databases cannot be opened.
 *      NSS_INIT_NOROOTINIT - Don't try to look for the root certs module
 *			automatically.
 *      NSS_INIT_OPTIMIZESPACE - Use smaller tables and caches.
 *      NSS_INIT_PK11THREADSAFE - only load PKCS#11 modules that are
 *                      thread-safe, ie. that support locking - either OS
 *                      locking or NSS-provided locks . If a PKCS#11
 *                      module isn't thread-safe, don't serialize its
 *                      calls; just don't load it instead. This is necessary
 *                      if another piece of code is using the same PKCS#11
 *                      modules that NSS is accessing without going through
 *                      NSS, for example the Java SunPKCS11 provider.
 *      NSS_INIT_PK11RELOAD - ignore the CKR_CRYPTOKI_ALREADY_INITIALIZED
 *                      error when loading PKCS#11 modules. This is necessary
 *                      if another piece of code is using the same PKCS#11
 *                      modules that NSS is accessing without going through
 *                      NSS, for example Java SunPKCS11 provider.
 *      NSS_INIT_NOPK11FINALIZE - never call C_Finalize on any
 *                      PKCS#11 module. This may be necessary in order to
 *                      ensure continuous operation and proper shutdown
 *                      sequence if another piece of code is using the same
 *                      PKCS#11 modules that NSS is accessing without going
 *                      through NSS, for example Java SunPKCS11 provider.
 *                      The following limitation applies when this is set :
 *                      SECMOD_WaitForAnyTokenEvent will not use
 *                      C_WaitForSlotEvent, in order to prevent the need for
 *                      C_Finalize. This call will be emulated instead.
 *      NSS_INIT_RESERVED - Currently has no effect, but may be used in the
 *                      future to trigger better cooperation between PKCS#11
 *                      modules used by both NSS and the Java SunPKCS11
 *                      provider. This should occur after a new flag is defined
 *                      for C_Initialize by the PKCS#11 working group.
 *      NSS_INIT_COOPERATE - Sets 4 recommended options for applications that
 *                      use both NSS and the Java SunPKCS11 provider.
 *
 * Also NOTE: This is not the recommended method for initializing NSS. 
 * The prefered method is NSS_init().
