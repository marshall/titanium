Description:
The Speex is a patent-free, Open Source/Free Software voice codec. Unlike other codecs like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, Speex is designed to compress voice at bitrates in the 2-45 kbps range. This is a recommended version that is also the first release where libspeex can be built without a floating point support.

Local Modifications:
  - Extracted the above package into third_party, without modifications.
  - Renamed libspeex/window.c to libspeex/window_spx.c to avoid name collision (with file with similar name in libtremor source).
  - Ran ./configure on a LINUX box to generate config.h and speex/include/speex_config_types.h
  - Added this file (README.google).
