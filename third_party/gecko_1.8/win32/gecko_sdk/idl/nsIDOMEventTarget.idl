   * triggered during a later stage of event flow, such as the bubbling phase.
   * 
   * If multiple identical EventListeners are registered on the same 
   * EventTarget with the same parameters the duplicate instances are 
   * discarded. They do not cause the EventListener to be called twice 
   * and since they are discarded they do not need to be removed with the 
   * removeEventListener method.

   * @param   type The event type for which the user is registering
   * @param   listener The listener parameter takes an interface 
   *                   implemented by the user which contains the methods 
   *                   to be called when the event occurs.
   * @param   useCapture If true, useCapture indicates that the user 
   *                     wishes to initiate capture. After initiating 
   *                     capture, all events of the specified type will be

   *                     through the tree will not trigger an
