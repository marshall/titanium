NSPL Events

Defining Events
---------------

Events are essentially structures that represent argument lists for a
function that will run on another thread. All event structures you
define must include a PLEvent struct as their first field:

    typedef struct MyEventType {
        PLEvent	e;
		// arguments follow...
        int	x;
		char*	y;
    } MyEventType;

It is also essential that you establish a model of ownership for each
argument passed in an event record, i.e. whether particular arguments
will be deleted by the event destruction callback, or whether they
only loaned to the event handler callback, and guaranteed to persist
until the time at which the handler is called.

Sending Events
--------------

Events are initialized by PL_InitEvent and can be sent via
PL_PostEvent or PL_PostSynchronousEvent. Events can also have an
owner. The owner of an event can revoke all the events in a given
event-queue by calling PL_RevokeEvents. An owner might want
to do this if, for instance, it is being destroyed, and handling the
events after the owner's destruction would cause an error (e.g. an
MWContext).

Since the act of initializing and posting an event must be coordinated
with it's possible revocation, it is essential that the event-queue's
monitor be entered surrounding the code that constructs, initializes
and posts the event:

    void postMyEvent(MyOwner* owner, int x, char* y)
    {
		MyEventType* event;

		PL_ENTER_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);

		// construct
		event = PR_NEW(MyEventType);
		if (event == NULL) goto done;

		// initialize
		PL_InitEvent(event, owner,
					 (PLHandleEventProc)handleMyEvent,
					 (PLDestroyEventProc)destroyMyEvent);
		event->x = x;
		event->y = strdup(y);

		// post
		PL_PostEvent(myQueue, &event->e);

      done:
		PL_EXIT_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);
    }

If you don't call PL_InitEvent and PL_PostEvent within the
event-queue's monitor, you'll get a big red assert. 

Handling Events
---------------

To handle an event you must write a callback that is passed the event
record you defined containing the event's arguments:

    void* handleMyEvent(MyEventType* event)
    {
		doit(event->x, event->y);
		return NULL;	// you could return a value for a sync event
    }

Similarly for the destruction callback:

    void destroyMyEvent(MyEventType* event)
    {
		free(event->y);	// created by strdup
		free(event);
    }

Processing Events in Your Event Loop
------------------------------------

If your main loop only processes events delivered to the event queue,
things are rather simple. You just get the next event (which may
block), and then handle it:

    while (1) {
		event = PL_GetEvent(myQueue);
		PL_HandleEvent(event);
    }

However, if other things must be waited on, you'll need to obtain a
file-descriptor that represents your event queue, and hand it to select:

    fd = PL_GetEventQueueSelectFD(myQueue);
    ...add fd to select set...
    while (select(...)) {
		if (...fd...) {
		    PL_ProcessPendingEvents(myQueue);
		}
		...
    }

Of course, with Motif and Windows it's more complicated than that, and
on Mac it's completely different, but you get the picture.

Revoking Events
---------------
If at any time an owner of events is about to be destroyed, you must
take steps to ensure that no one tries to use the event queue after
the owner is gone (or a crash may result). You can do this by either
processing all the events in the queue before destroying the owner:

    {
		...
		PL_ENTER_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);
		PL_ProcessPendingEvents(myQueue);
		DestroyMyOwner(owner);
		PL_EXIT_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);
		...
    }

or by revoking the events that are in the queue for that owner. This
removes them from the queue and calls their destruction callback:

    {
		...
		PL_ENTER_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);
		PL_RevokeEvents(myQueue, owner);
		DestroyMyOwner(owner);
		PL_EXIT_EVENT_QUEUE_MONITOR(myQueue);
		...
    }

In either case it is essential that you be in the event-queue's monitor
to ensure that all events are removed from the queue for that owner, 
and to ensure that no more events will be delivered for that owner.
