Local Modifications:
  Header files were extracted for use in Firefox. Firefox requires GTK+ 2
  therefore the library will be on the system.

  The library for GTK+ 2 was made for use by notifer_test and notifier
  daemon. The code downloaded from the above site was build on Ubuntu 6.06.
  The resulting library "libgtk-x11-2.0.so" was copied from
  gtk+-2.8.20/gtk/.libs to linux/lib.
