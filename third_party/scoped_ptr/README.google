Source files and modifications
==============================

scoped_ptr_malloc added in by Ray Sidney of Google.  When one of these goes
out of scope, instead of doing a delete or delete[], it calls free().
scoped_ptr_malloc<char> is likely to see much more use than any other
specializations.

"typedef char type_must_be_complete[sizeof(T)];" was removed from 
scoped_ptr_malloc because this condition interfered with using scoped_ptr_malloc
in places, and this condition isn't necessary.

release() added in by Spencer Kimball of Google. Use this to conditionally
transfer ownership of a heap-allocated object to the caller, usually on
method success.
