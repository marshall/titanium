Glint is a simple UI and rendering framework.

It is downloaded from http://glint-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk at revision 23.

I removed following directories:
 third_party (has expat xml library, gnu tools and smart_ptr)
 tools (build scripts)
 test
 sample_apps
Also, removed Makefile and make.bat that build sample applications.
-------------------------
Modifications:
 changed in linux/linux.h:
 from:
  #include "glint/third_party/scoped_ptr/scoped_ptr.h"
 to:
  #include "third_party/scoped_ptr/scoped_ptr.h"
 to pick up Gears' implementation.
-------------------------
To get new Glint drop, I checkout Glint revision to lets say c:\glint_svn and 
then use thise commands (on Windows):

cd /d [location of gears\opensource\third_party\glint]
p4 edit ...
robocopy c:\glint_svn\glint . /S /XD .svn third_party test tools sample_apps bin* /XF Makefile make.bat COPYING README.google
notepad revision.txt  <-- update the number to match svn version
p4 revert -a ...      <-- this reverts all files that were not changed.

Don't forget to check if linux/linux.h has a patch mentioned above.
