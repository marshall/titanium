Description
===========

jsoncpp is an implementation of a JSON (http://json.org) reader and writer in
C++. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to
parse and generate. [From website]

Source files and modifications
==============================

The files in the initial submission to third_party/jsoncpp contain SVN revision
#23, that was checked out using the following command:

$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp jsoncpp
..
Checked out revision 23.

The original distribution uses Scons build system which was too complicated and
unneccessary. The files were ported to the make build system.

The following changes were made:
# src/lib_json/*.cpp files were renamed to .cc and moved to main directory,
# include/json/.h files were moved to main directory,
# src/lib_json/*.inl files were renamed to .h and moved to main directory,
# include file paths were changed to "third_party/jsoncpp/*.h",
# an unnecessary typedef was removed to make gcc happy,
# several changes were made to fix gcc warnings caused by wrong initialization
  order in constructors,
# files in original doc/* were copied to doc/*, except for "sconscript", HTML
  documentation was generated using doxygen.
# tests were moved from tests/ to testdata, test_large_0[12] were added.
# a few static_cast<>s were made to fix gcc warnings about signed vs unsigned
  comparisons and assignments
# modified some lines exceeding 80 characters to fit within 80 chars
# include paths were changed to match Gears's build environment
# json_writer.cc was modified to include the escaping code that was added to the
  jsoncpp project at revision 33.
# and more. To see all changes, diff against the original files
  (see below for how to find them).


The original files (revision 23) can be found in jsoncpp_orig.tar.gz.
Patches from original files can be found in patches/ subdirectory.

Some of the changes were submitted back to the package author.

Unittests
=========

src/jsontestrunner/main.cpp was renamed to json_test.cc, which compiles to
json_test binary.

test/runjsontests.py was renamed to json_unittest.py and heavily modified. It
runs the json_test binary on testdata/*.json and reports if any of them fail.
