# The sqlite3BtreeInsert() API now has an additional "nZero" parameter
# which specifies the number of zero bytes to append to the end of the
# data.  This feature allows large zero-filled BLOBs to be created without
# having to allocate a big chunk of memory to instantiate the blob.
#
# The following code tests the new feature.
