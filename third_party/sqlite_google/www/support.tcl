<h3>Direct E-Mail To The Author</h3>

<p>
Use the mailing list.
Please do <b>not</b> send email directly to the author of SQLite
unless:
<ul>
<li>You have or intend to acquire a professional support contract
as described below, or</li>
<li>You are working on an open source project.</li>
</ul>
You are welcomed to use SQLite in closed source, proprietary, and/or
commerical projects and to ask questions about such use on the public
mailing list.  But please do not ask to receive free direct technical
support.  The software is free; direct technical support is not.
</p>

or if you want custom modifications to SQLite performed by the
