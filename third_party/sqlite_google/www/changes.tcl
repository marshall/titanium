chng {2007 June 18 (3.4.0)} {
<li>Fix a bug that can lead to database corruption if an SQLITE_BUSY error
    occurs in the middle of an explicit transaction and that transaction
    is later committed.  
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2409">Ticket #2409.</a>
    See the
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">
    CorruptionFollowingBusyError</a> wiki page for details.</i>
<li>Fix a bug that can lead to database corruption if autovacuum mode is
    on and a malloc() failure follows a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement
    which itself follows a cache overflow inside a transaction.  See
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2418">ticket #2418</a>. 
    </li>
<li>Added explicit <a href="limits.html">upper bounds</a> on the sizes and
    quantities of things SQLite can process.  This change might cause
    compatibility problems for
    applications that use SQLite in the extreme, which is why the current
    release is 3.4.0 instead of 3.3.18.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="capi3ref.html#sqlite3_blob_open">
    Incremental BLOB I/O</a>.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="capi3ref.html#sqlite3_bind_zeroblob">zeroblob API</a>
    and the <a href="lang_expr.html#zeroblob">zeroblob()</a> SQL function.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">
    Incremental Vacuum</a>.</li>
<li>Added the SQLITE_MIXED_ENDIAN_64BIT_FLOAT compile-time option to suppport
    ARM7 processors with goofy endianness.</li>
<li>Removed all instances of sprintf() and strcpy() from the core library.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">
    International Components for Unicode (ICU)</a> to the full-text search
    extensions.
</ul><p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>In the windows OS driver, reacquire a SHARED lock if an attempt to
    acquire an EXCLUSIVE lock fails.  Ticket #2354</li>
<li>Fix the REPLACE() function so that it returns NULL if the second argument
    is an empty string.  Ticket #2324.</li>
<li>Document the hazards of type coversions in
    <a href="capi3ref.html#sqlite3_column_blob">sqlite3_column_blob()</a>
    and related APIs.  Fix unnecessary type conversions.  Ticket #2321.</li>
<li>Internationalization of the TRIM() function.  Ticket #2323</li>
<li>Use memmove() instead of memcpy() when moving between memory regions
    that might overlap.  Ticket #2334</li>
<li>Fix an optimizer bug involving subqueries in a compound SELECT that has
    both an ORDER BY and a LIMIT clause.  Ticket #2339.</li>
<li>Make sure the <a href="capi3ref.html#sqlite3_snprintf">sqlite3_snprintf()
    </a> interface does not zero-terminate the buffer if the buffer size is
    less than 1.  Ticket #2341</li>
<li>Fix the built-in printf logic so that it prints "NaN" not "Inf" for
    floating-point NaNs.  Ticket #2345</li>
<li>When converting BLOB to TEXT, use the text encoding of the main database.
    Ticket #2349</li>

    NUMERIC.  Ticket #2364</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the handling of UTF16 codepoint 0xE000</li>
<li>Consider explicit collate clauses when matching WHERE constraints
    to indices in the query optimizer.  Ticket #2391</li>
<li>Fix the query optimizer to correctly handle constant expressions in 
    the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN.  Ticket #2403</li>
<li>Fix the query optimizer to handle rowid comparisions to NULL
    correctly.  Ticket #2404</li>
<li>Fix many potental segfaults that could be caused by malicious SQL
    statements.</li>
}

chng {2007 April 25 (3.3.17)} {
<li>When the "write_version" value of the database header is larger than
    what the library understands, make the database read-only instead of
    unreadable.</li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
}

chng {2007 April 18 (3.3.16)} {
<li>Fix a bug that caused VACUUM to fail if NULLs appeared in a
    UNIQUE column.</li>
<li>Reinstate performance improvements that were added in 3.3.14
    but regressed in 3.3.15.</li>
<li>Fix problems with the handling of ORDER BY expressions on
    compound SELECT statements in subqueries.</li>
<li>Fix a potential segfault when destroying locks on WinCE in
    a multi-threaded environment.</li>
<li>Documentation updates.</li>
}

chng {2007 April 9 (3.3.15)} {
<li>Fix a bug introduced in 3.3.14 that caused a rollback of
    CREATE TEMP TABLE to leave the database connection wedged.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that caused an extra NULL row to be returned when
    a descending query was interrupted by a change to the database.</li>
<li>The FOR EACH STATEMENT clause on a trigger now causes a syntax
    error.  It used to be silently ignored.</li>
<li>Fix an obscure and relatively harmless problem that might have caused
    a resource leak following an I/O error.</li>
<li>Many improvements to the test suite.  Test coverage now exceeded 98%</li>
}

chng {2007 April 2 (3.3.14)} {
<li>Fix a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2273">bug</a>
    in 3.3.13 that could cause a segfault when the IN operator
    is used one one term of a two-column index and the right-hand side of
    the IN operator contains a NULL.</li>
<li>Added a new OS interface method for determining the sector size
    of underlying media:  sqlite3OsSectorSize().</li>
<li>A new algorithm for statements of the form
    INSERT INTO <i>table1</i> SELECT * FROM <i>table2</i>
    is faster and reduces fragmentation.  VACUUM uses statements of
    this form and thus runs faster and defragments better.</li>
<li>Performance enhancements through reductions in disk I/O:
<ul>
<li>Do not read the last page of an overflow chain when
    deleting the row - just add that page to the freelist.</li>
<li>Do not store pages being deleted in the 
    rollback journal.</li>
<li>Do not read in the (meaningless) content of
    pages extracted from the freelist.</li>
<li>Do not flush the page cache (and thus avoiding
    a cache refill) unless another process changes the underlying
    database file.</li>
<li>Truncate rather than delete the rollback journal when committing
    a transaction in exclusive access mode, or when committing the TEMP
    database.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added support for exclusive access mode using
    <a href="pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode">
    "PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE"</a></li>
<li>Use heap space instead of stack space for large buffers in the
    pager - useful on embedded platforms with  stack-space
    limitations.</li>
<li>Add a makefile target "sqlite3.c" that builds an amalgamation containing
    the core SQLite library C code in a single file.</li>
<li>Get the library working correctly when compiled 
    with GCC option "-fstrict-aliasing".</li>
<li>Removed the vestigal SQLITE_PROTOCOL error.</li>
<li>Improvements to test coverage, other minor bugs fixed,
    memory leaks plugged,
    code refactored and/or recommented in places for easier reading.</li>
}

used by an expression.  This feature is considered experimental pending
additional testing.</li>

<li>Added two new experimental functions:
<a href="lang_expr.html#randomblobFunc">randomBlob()</a> and
<a href="lang_expr.html#hexFunc">hex()</a>.
Their intended use is to facilitate generating 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID">UUIDs</a>.
</li>
<li>Fix a problem where
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_count_changes">PRAGMA count_changes</a> was

    an abort and rollback.  See the documentation on the "ON CONFLICT"
    clause for details.</li>
<li>Temporary files are now automatically deleted by the operating system
    when closed.  There are no more dangling temporary files on a program
    crash.  (If the OS crashes, fsck will delete the file after reboot 
    under Unix.  I do not know what happens under Windows.)</li>

    newlines anywhere in the data.  This is an old bug that was carried
    forward from version 1.0.  To fix it, the ".dump" output no longer

    iso8859-x, as it has always done.  This only makes a difference for
    LIKE and GLOB operators and the LENGTH and SUBSTR functions.</li>
<li>If the library is not configured for UTF-8 and the Tcl library
    is one of the newer ones that uses UTF-8 internally,

    back again is done inside the TCL interface.</li>

<li>Added limited support for transactions.  At this point, transactions

<li>Added special column names ROWID, OID, and _ROWID_ that refer to the
    unique random integer key associated with every row of every table.</li>
<li>Additional tests added to the regression suite to cover the new ROWID
    feature and the TCL interface bugs mentioned below.</li>

    numbers of records to be deleted or updated into a temporary file.
