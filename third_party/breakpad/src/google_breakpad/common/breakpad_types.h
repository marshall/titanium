/* breakpad_types.h: Precise-width types
 *
 * (This is C99 source, please don't corrupt it with C++.)
 *
 * This file ensures that types u_intN_t are defined for N = 8, 16, 32, and
 * 64.  Types of precise widths are crucial to the task of writing data
 * structures on one platform and reading them on another.
