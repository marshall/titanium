<h1>Blob API</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<p>The 'Blob' object is a general-purpose way to reference binary data in
web applications.


<h3>Contents</h3>

  </ol>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>JavaScript has a built-in data type for text strings, but nothing for binary
data. The Blob object attempts to address this limitation.</p>

<p>A Blob is a reference to an opaque block of binary data.</p>

<p>Blobs are a general-purpose interchange format.  They can be passed into,
and returned by, a variety of Gears methods.  Blobs are, in many ways, parallel
to Strings.  Most APIs that accept a 'String' could be updated to accept
'String-or-Blob'.</p>

<p>Blobs are immutable.  The binary data referenced by a Blob cannot be
modified directly.  (This guarantees Blobs will have predictable behavior when
passed to asynchronous APIs.)  In practice, this is not a limitation; APIs can
accept Blobs and return new Blobs.  Note that JavaScript strings are also
immutable; they behave the same way.</p>


<h3 id="throwing">Throwing exceptions</h3>

<p><b>Any</b> operation involving a Blob may throw an exception.  This
includes:
  <ul>
  <li>calling all APIs that accept Blob arguments.
  <li>accessing any attribute or method on a Blob object.
  </ul>
Callers should be prepared to handle exceptions in all these cases.</p>

<p>Exceptions can occur because Blobs may be backed by user files.  If such a
file changes, the Blob referencing it is no longer valid.</p>

<p>It is somewhat uncommon for files to change while they are being referenced.
But web applications that want to be completely robust should handle this
scenario.</p>


<h4>Permission</h4>

<p>The Blob API does not require user permission.</p>
