<h1>WorkerPool API</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<p>The WorkerPool API allows web applications to run JavaScript code
in the background, without blocking the main page's script execution.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In web browsers a single time-intensive operation, such as I/O or
heavy computation, can make the UI unresponsive.  The WorkerPool API
runs operations in the background, without blocking the UI.
Scripts executing in the WorkerPool will not trigger the browser's
"unresponsive script" dialog.
<h4>Permission</h4>

<p>This API requires user permission.  If you would like to customize the default dialog, you can explicitly call <code>google.gears.factory.getPermission()</code> - <a href="api_factory.html">see how.</a></p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="<a href='tools.html#gears_init'>gears_init.js</a>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
// main.js
var workerPool = google.gears.factory.create('beta.workerpool');

workerPool.onmessage = function(a, b, message) {
  alert('Received message from worker ' + message.sender + ': \n' + message.body);
};

var childWorkerId = workerPool.createWorkerFromUrl('worker.js');

workerPool.sendMessage(["3..2..", 1, {helloWorld: "Hello world!"}], childWorkerId);
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<pre><code>// worker.js
var wp = google.gears.workerPool;
wp.onmessage = function(a, b, message) {
  var reply = message.body[0] + message.body[1] + "... " + message.body[2].helloWorld;
  wp.sendMessage(reply, message.sender);
}</code></pre>


<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="isolation">Code and data isolation</h3>

<p>The WorkerPool behaves like a collection of processes, rather than threads.
<b>Workers do not share any execution state.</b>  Changing a variable in
one worker has no effect in any other worker.  And created workers do not
automatically inherit script code from their parents.

<p>Members of a WorkerPool interact with each other only by sending message
objects.

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>A created worker does not have access to the DOM; objects like
<code>document</code> and <code>window</code> exist only on the main page.
This is a consequence of workers not sharing any execution state.

<p>However, workers do have access to all JavaScript built-in functions.  Most
Gears methods can also be used, through a global variable that is
automatically defined: <code>google.gears.factory</code>.  (One exception is
the LocalServer file submitter, which requires the DOM.)  For other
functionality, created workers can ask the main page to carry out requests.


<h3 id="typical_use">Usage pattern</h3>

<p>To understand how to use the WorkerPool API, it is useful to look at
a typical example.

  <h4>Initialization sequence</h4>

<ol>
<li>JavaScript code (the "parent" worker) uses <code>google.gears.factory</code>
    to create a WorkerPool <code>wp</code>.
<li>The parent indicates where incoming messages should go by setting
    <code>wp.onmessage</code>.  It does this <i>before</i> calling
    <code>createWorker()</code> to help ensure no messages will be lost.
<li>For each new worker (a "child" worker):

  <ol class="alpha">
  <li>The parent calls <code>wp.createWorkerFromUrl()</code> with a URL that
      returns the full body of script the child will contain.
  <li><code>createWorkerFromUrl()</code> returns immediately and the parent
      continues running.
  <li>In parallel, the child fetches its script code and runs through it once.
      During this time the child must set its <code>onmessage</code> handler,
      on the predefined global variable <code>google.gears.workerPool</code>.
  </ol>
</ol>


  <h4>Communication</h4>

<p>Workers send messages to each other using <code>sendMessage()</code>.
Any member of a particular WorkerPool can communicate with any other member.
  
<p>Each sent message triggers the receiver's <code>onmessage</code> handler.
Message events are handled like all other JavaScript events.  In particular,
processing is interleaved the same way: there is an event queue, and the next
event handler is not called until the previous one returns.

<p>The WorkerPool is <i>not</i> a singleton.  A page can create multiple
WorkerPool instances, and these pools are isolated from each other.  This
enables multiple gadgets on a page, for example, to use the WorkerPool API
without fear of collision.
  

<p>How does script know which worker ID to send messages to?  There are two
common ways:

<ol>
<li>Use the second parameter to <code>onmessage</code>, which contains the
    sender's worker ID.  A "grunt" worker whose purpose is to <u>execute
    requests asynchronously</u> will often use this method, blindly
    responding to whichever worker made the request.
<li>Use the value returned by <code>createWorker()</code>, which is the ID
    of the newly created worker.  A worker whose purpose is to <u>coordinate
    tasks</u> (usually the application's "main" JavaScript code) will often use
    this method.  The ID can be sent to, and used by, any member of the
    WorkerPool, but this is seldom necessary.
</ol>

      This callback provides functionality in workers similar to the
      <code><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.onerror"
      >window.onerror</code></a> property. If set, it will be
      called for any unhandled errors that occur inside a worker.<br><br>

      You can use this callback to implement "last-chance" error handling for
      your workers. For example, you could log all unhandled errors into the
      <a href="api_database.html">Database API</a>.<br><br>

      <span color='red'>NOTE:</span> This callback can only be set from child workers.
