<h1>Gears and Security</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<p>This page describes the security model used in Gears, and
  discusses what developers can do to build secure applications.

<a name="model" id="model"></a>
<h1>Basic Security Model</h1>

<p>Gears uses the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin
  policy</a> as its underlying security model. A web page with a
  particular <i>scheme, host, and port</i> can only access resources with the
  same <i>scheme, host, and port</i>.

<p>This means a site using Gears:
  <ul>
  <li>Database: Can only open databases created for that site's origin.
  <li>LocalServer: Can only capture URLs and use manifests from the site's
      origin.
  </ul>

<p>Sometimes web applications on different origins may want to share resources.
  We are investigating ideas for granting permissions across origins.



<a name="permissions" id="permissions"></a>
<h1>Permissions Dialog</h1>

<p>To protect users, Gears shows a warning dialog when a site
  first attempts to use the Gears API. User opt-in is important
  because Gears allows applications to store data on the user's
  hard disk.

<p>Users can grant or deny access for each security origin.  When a user grants
access to Gears for a particular origin, Gears remembers this decision for
future visits. Denying access is only until the page is reloaded, though users
can also choose to never allow a particular site to access Gears. Remembered
decisions can later be changed using the Gears Settings dialog, located
in the browser's Tools menu.



<a name="enduserdata" id="enduserdata"></a>
<h1>Security of End-User Data</h1>

<p>Gears data files are protected with the user's operating system
  login credentials. Users with separate login names cannot access each other's
  Gears data files, as enforced by the operating system.

<p>On the other hand, two people using the same OS login could theoretically
  access each other's Gears data files, just as they could access any other
  file on the machine.

<h1>Best Practices</h1>


<h2>Database Security</h2>
&nbsp;

  <p class="caution"><strong>Best Practice:</strong>:
    Avoid SQL injection attacks. Never insert user input directly into a
    SQL statement. Instead, use substitution parameters in
    <span class="code">Database.execute()</span>.
  </p>

<p>An attacker may run unintended SQL commands using a technique called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>.

<p>To avoid this, developers should pass user input to SQL statements
  <i>only</i> through the question mark (<code>?</code>)
  substitution parameter.  This way, the input will get correctly escaped
  before being executed.

<p>For example, write this:<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <code>db.execute('insert into MyTable values (?)', data);</code><br>
instead of this:<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <code>db.execute('insert into MyTable values (' + data + ')');</code>



<h3>User Opt-In</h3>
&nbsp;

  <p class="caution"><strong>Best Practice</strong>:
    Store offline preferences locally. Applications should treat a user's
    "enable offline features" choice as a per-machine setting.
  </p>

<p>Users may run your application from multiple machines, and they may
  not want their data stored locally on every machine.  For this reason,
  store the choice in a local database.
