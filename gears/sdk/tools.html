<h1>Resources and Tools</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<p>This page contains  resources that you can include in your application, and debugging tools to help while you're developing your application using Gears. </p>
<h1><a name="gears_init" id="gears_init"></a>Resources</h1>
<h2>The gears_init.js source file </h2>
<p>Always include the gears_init.js file in your application to get access to the Gears factory and APIs. Save the file using the link below. 
<div class="linkbox">
  <div align="center"><a href="gears_init.js">Get gears_init.js</a></div>
</div></p>

<a name="samples_and_tools" id="samples_and_tools"></a>
<p>The <code>google.gears.factory</code> is the only supported method to access
GearsFactory. The way Gears is exposed in the browser could change in
the future, but we will always support the <code>google.gears.factory</code>
object.</p>

<h2>Samples and Tools download</h2>

<p>All of the sample applications and the tools described below are found in
the zip file provided here. Download the file to your computer and unzip it to
access the files.</p>

<p><div class="linkbox">
  <div align="center"><a href="GearsSamplesAndTools.zip">Download Samples and Tools  </a></div>
</div></p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>Like all Gears applications, tools can only examine the database within their own domain. To examine your application's database, you must copy the tool into your application and load it from within the same domain as the application.</p>

<p class="note"><span style="color:red">Note:</span> To use these tools,
download the Samples and Tools zip file above, then copy the tools into your
application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Database Query Tool</h2>
<p>The database query tool allows you to run SQL queries interactively against a Gears database. Run this tool from the same domain as the database you wish to inspect. </p>

<h2>LocalServer Inspector</h2>
<p>Inspect the contents of the <a href="api_localserver.html">LocalServer</a>, capture URLs,
and test <a href="api_localserver.html#ManagedResourceStore">ManagedResourceStores</a>.</p>
