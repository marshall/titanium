Gearpad is a sample Gears-enabled web application that implements a basic 
notepad. The notepad can be viewed and edited offline, and Gearpad will 
transition seamlessly between connected and disconnected. Changes that were made
offline are synchronized in the background when a connection becomes available.

You can run Gearpad on your own server to experiment with it and learn how to
make your own offline-enabled application.

Prerequisites:
- PHP (http://php.net)
- MySQL (http://mysql.com)

Setup:
- Create a new database in MySQL called 'gearpad'.
- Import db.sql to initialize the new database's schema, like this:
  mysql -u myusername -p gearpad < db.sql
- Copy the gearpad directory into your PHP web root.
- Modify _dbconfig.php and add the details about the database and user to use
  with MySQL.
