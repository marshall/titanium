<p>Click the button below to test the desktop shortcut feature.

<p><input type="button" value="Create Desktop Shortcut" onclick="createShortcut()">

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>You can specify up to four icon sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128. 
    You must specify at least one of these, but for the best looking results on 
    all platforms, we recommend specifying all four.
  <li>The description parameter is optional. If specified, it is displayed in
    the dialog the user sees.
  <li>On Windows, users also have the option to create shortcuts in the Start 
    Menu and Quick Lauch area.
</ul>
