       <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scintilla/scite176.zip?download">Release 1.76</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
	<li>
	Released on 16 March 2008.
	</li>
	<li>
	Support for PowerShell.
	</li>
	<li>
	Lexer added for Magik.
	</li>
	<li>
	Director extension working on GTK+.
	</li>
	<li>
	Director extension may set focus to SciTE through "focus:" message on GTK+.
	</li>
	<li>
	C++ folder handles final line better in some cases.
	</li>
	<li>
	SCI_COPYALLOWLINE added which is similar to SCI_COPY except that if the selection is empty then
	the line holding the caret is copied. On Windows an extra clipboard format allows pasting this as a whole
	line before the current selection. This behaviour is compatible with Visual Studio.
	</li>
	<li>
	On Windows, the horizontal scroll bar can handle wider files.
	</li>
	<li>
	On Windows, a system palette leak was fixed. Should not affect many as palette mode is rarely used.
	</li>
	<li>
	Install command on GTK+ no longer tries to set explicit owner.
	</li>
	<li>
	Perl lexer handles defined-or operator "//".
	</li>
	<li>
	Octave lexer fixes "!=" operator.
	</li>
	<li>
	Optimized selection change drawing to not redraw as much when not needed.
	</li>
	<li>
	SciTE on GTK+ no longer echoes Lua commands so is same as on Windows.
	</li>
	<li>
	Automatic vertical scrolling limited to one line at a time so is not too fast.
	</li>
	<li>
	Crash fixed when line states set beyond end of line states. This occurred when lexers did not
	set a line state for each line.
	</li>
	<li>
	Crash in SciTE on Windows fixed when search for 513 character string fails.
	</li>
	<li>
	SciTE disables translucent features on Windows 9x due to crashes reported when using translucency.
	</li>
	<li>
	Bug fixed where whitespace background was not seen on wrapped lines.
	</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scintilla/scite175.zip?download">Release 1.75</a>

	code from SciTE.
	</li>
	<li>
	Borland C++ can no longer build Scintilla.
	</li>

	Invalid bytes in UTF-8 mode are displayed as hex blobs. This also prevents crashes due to
	passing invalid UTF-8 to platform calls.
	</li>
	<li>
	Indentation guides enhanced to be visible on completely empty lines when possible.
	</li>
	<li>
	The horizontal scroll bar may grow to match the widest line displayed.

	</li>
	<li>

	<li>
	On Windows versions that support Unicode well, Scintilla is a wide character window
	which allows input for some less common languages like Armenian, Devanagari,
	Tamil, and Georgian. To fully benefit, applications should use wide character calls.
	</li>
	<li>

	<li>
	Lexers added for Abaqus, Ansys APDL, Asymptote, and R.
	</li>
	<li>
	SCI_DELWORDRIGHTEND added for closer compatibility with GTK+ entry widget.
	</li>
	<li>

	underscores in numeric literals and vector/version strings,
	^D and ^Z similar to __END__,
	subroutine prototypes as a new lexical class,
	formats and format blocks as new lexical classes, and
	'/' suffixed keywords and barewords.
	</li>
	<li>
	Python lexer styles all of a decorator in the decorator style rather than just the name.
	</li>
	<li>
	YAML lexer styles colons as operators.
	</li>

	</li>
	<li>
	SciTE's extension and scripting interfaces add OnKey, OnDwellStart, and OnClose methods.
	</li>
	<li>
	On GTK+, copying to the clipboard does not include the text/urilist type since this caused problems when

	<li>
	Released on 17 December 2005.
	</li>
	<li>
	Scintilla checks the paint region more accurately when seeing if an area is being

	</li>
	<li>
	Quoted identifier style for SQL. SQL folding performed more simply.

	mode when a ?> is found.
	</li>
	<li>

	now used to ensure that the layout reentrancy problem that caused this
	is easier to find.
	</li>
	<li>
	Speed optimized for long lines and lines containing many control characters.
	</li>
	<li>

        use the old APIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        "if" and "import" statements in SciTE properties files allows modularisation into
        language-specific properties files and choices based upon platform.
        This means that SciTE is delivered with 9 language-specific properties files
        as well as the standard SciTEGlobal.properties file.

        Auto-completion lists automatically size more sensibly.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_CLEARDOCUMENTSTYLE zeroes all style bytes, ensures all
        lines are shown and deletes all folding information.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows, auto-completion lists are visually outdented rather than indented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all command in SciTE.

      <li>
        Setting a null document pointer creates an empty document.
      </li>
      <li>
        WM_GETTEXT can no longer overrun buffer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Polygon drawing bug fixed on GTK+.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java and JavaScript lexers merged into C++ lexer.
      </li>
      <li>
        C++ lexer indicates unterminated strings by colouring the end of the line
	rather than changing the rest of the file to string style. This is less
	obtrusive and helps the folding.

      <li>
        Printing support in Scintilla on Windows.

      <li>
        Styles can select colouring to end of line. This can be used when a file contains more than
        one language to differentiate between the areas in each language. An example is the HTML +
        JavaScript styling in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actions can be grouped in the undo stack, so they will be undone together. This grouping is
        hierarchical so higher level actions such as replace all can be undone in one go. Call to
        discover whether there are any actions to redo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of characters that define words can be changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers now have identifiers and can be found and deleted by their identifier. The empty
        marker type can be used to make a marker that is invisible and which is only used to trace
        where a particular line moves to.

        Windows version.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can save a styled copy of the current file in HTML format. As SciTE does not yet
        support printing, this can be used to print a file by then using a browser to print the
        HTML file.

      <li>
        Released on 17 May 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based IDE. "SciTE" is a
        SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning something like "understanding in a neat
        way" and is also an Old English version of the word "shit".
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters that will stop
        autocompletion mode. Autocompletion mode is cancelled when any cursor movement occurs apart
        from backspace.

        GTK+ version now contains all features of Windows version with some very small differences.
        Executing programs works much better now.
      </li>
      <li>
        New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour screen modes. A line
        number column can be displayed to the left of the selection margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back has been completely
        rewritten to be faster, and to allow markers to move with the text.

        Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. Changes to
        compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the container when
        the document is saved. Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is
        entered or left, allowing the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its
        menus.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the container should the
        user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the document out of a version
        control system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an API for setting the appearance of indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be implemented completely by the
        container. All of the keyboard commands are now commands which can be sent by the
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the line and
        the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this but my
        fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type marker to
        delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in most cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide remembers the current lines of files in the recently used list.
